# Early-warning-signals-for-nearly-1D-systems

This project contains the code used to generate the results of the research article 'Forecasting resilience profiles of the run-up to regime shifts in nearly-1D systems' to be published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Please see the article for more details about the methods used here.

The code is written in MATLAB and requires the function 'lsqcurvefit' from the Optimization Toolbox to perform nonlinear least squares. It should run without the toolbox if an alternative fitting function can be found.
